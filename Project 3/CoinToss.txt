You are responsible for writing a program that will simulate flipping a coin n number of times.Your program will present the user an option to see the result of each individual flip. Your program will also inform the user any time the number of heads flipped is equal to the number of tails flipped. Upon completion of all flips, your program will provide a summary table that shows the number and percentage of each flip.


n = 10


Head  4/10   40%
Tail  6/10   60%
